TRIP GRAM APP:
Travel destinations are a very personal choice. Sure, there may be certain countries that are easier to travel to, or cheaper to travel to, but at the end of the day you’re the one that has to decide where.


So where do you want to go?
 
You know you want to take a vacation, but you have no idea where? 

The first thing you do is you are going to see a travel agent who will be able to pick a good trip for you. 


But what if the trip has to be short and close by? You can’t go every time to a travel agency or have time to do research? What if you just want to see a new place and spend time with your family?

If you just take a minute to ask yourself this question you'll know the answer once you use TRIP GRAM! We have a collection of places that people have done trips and you can filter it how far you want to go!



The website provides a platform for members who want to share experience of places and people who need an idea of where to go.

Our personal struggle to look for perfect weekend spots with family or friends made us bring this platform to life.
